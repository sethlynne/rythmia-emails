      <p>Hi [NAME],</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Rythmia Tribe!
      </p>
      <p>
        First off, let me be very, very clear on this. I email a LOT - almost daily.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's stuff designed to help you on your journey to achieving your miracle. If that offends you, well, you shouldn't be on this list. Afterall, how can I realistically show you how to make the most of your life, if I don't do it in mine?
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I believe in "going deep", not wide. In other words, this is all I do.
      </p>
