      <p>Hi [NAME],</p>

      <p>
        I am so grateful to the community of friends we have been blessed with. A special thank you to each and every one of you who have done so much to support us this past month. We have friends sharing the documentary The Reality of Truth on
        YouTube (see the film here), providing ratings and reviews on Google Maps (see reviews here) and TripAdvisor (see reviews here), podcast interviews, health and wellness articles for the press, video testimonials, refer-a-friend and word of
        mouth. Thank you for helping us by sharing your enthusiasm with your networks of like-minded friends and family.
      </p>
